## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Strategy for Live Database

### **Safe Migration Approach**
1. **Pre-Migration Safety**
   ```bash
   # Create full database backup
   pg_dump sabc_production > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   
   # Test migration on copy
   createdb sabc_migration_test
   psql sabc_migration_test < backup_latest.sql
   python manage.py migrate --plan  # Review migration plan
   python manage.py migrate        # Test migration
   ```

2. **Blue-Green Deployment Pattern**
   - Deploy new version to parallel environment
   - Test with production data copy
   - Switch traffic only after validation
   - Keep old version running for immediate rollback

3. **Database Schema Evolution**
   - All schema changes must be backward compatible
   - Use Django's migration system with custom migration scripts
   - Implement gradual rollout for data transformations
   - Maintain audit trail of all schema changes

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Rollback Plan**: Every deployment must have tested rollback procedure
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive data validation before and after migrations  
- **Downtime Window**: Plan for maximum 15-minute maintenance windows
- **Communication**: Notify users of planned maintenance 48 hours in advance
