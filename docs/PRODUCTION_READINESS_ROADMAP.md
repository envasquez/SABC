    """Ensure user is authenticated and has an angler profile with membership."""
    if not self.request.user.is_authenticated:
        return False
    try:
        return hasattr(self.request.user, 'angler') and self.request.user.angler.member
    except AttributeError:
        return False
```

    context["total_points"] = Result.objects.filter(...)       # Query 2  
    context["biggest_bass"] = Result.objects.filter(...)       # Query 3

# After: Optimized with select_related and aggregation (3-5 queries per page)
def get_aoy_results_optimized(year):
    return Result.objects.filter(...).select_related(
        'angler__user', 'tournament__event'
    ).aggregate(
        total_points=Sum('points'),
        total_weight=Sum('total_weight'),
        # ... single query approach
    )
```

#### **Database Configuration Issues** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
```python
# ‚úÖ FIXED: Clean database configuration in settings.py
if (os.environ.get("UNITTEST") or os.environ.get("GITHUB_ACTIONS") or 
    any("test" in arg for arg in sys.argv)):
    DATABASES = {"default": {"ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3"}}  # Test environments
else:
    DATABASES = {"default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2",

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Strategy for Live Database

### **Safe Migration Approach**
1. **Pre-Migration Safety**
   ```bash
   # Create full database backup
   pg_dump sabc_production > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   
   # Test migration on copy
   createdb sabc_migration_test
   psql sabc_migration_test < backup_latest.sql
   python manage.py migrate --plan  # Review migration plan
   python manage.py migrate        # Test migration
   ```

2. **Blue-Green Deployment Pattern**
   - Deploy new version to parallel environment
   - Test with production data copy
   - Switch traffic only after validation
   - Keep old version running for immediate rollback

3. **Database Schema Evolution**
   - All schema changes must be backward compatible
   - Use Django's migration system with custom migration scripts
   - Implement gradual rollout for data transformations
   - Maintain audit trail of all schema changes

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Rollback Plan**: Every deployment must have tested rollback procedure
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive data validation before and after migrations  
- **Downtime Window**: Plan for maximum 15-minute maintenance windows
- **Communication**: Notify users of planned maintenance 48 hours in advance
