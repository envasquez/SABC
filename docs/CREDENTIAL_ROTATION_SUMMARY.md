# Credential Rotation Summary - October 7, 2025

## Security Audit Findings

During a comprehensive security audit on **October 7, 2025**, the following security vulnerabilities were identified:

### Exposed Credentials

1. **Gmail SMTP App Password**: `mjpu bxfh yglw geqo`
   - **Exposure**: Found in local `.env` file (not committed to git)
   - **Risk Level**: HIGH - Full email sending capability
   - **Impact**: Attacker could send emails on behalf of SABC

2. **Weak SECRET_KEY**: `your-secret-key-here`
   - **Exposure**: Placeholder value potentially used in development
   - **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Session/CSRF bypass
   - **Impact**: Session hijacking, CSRF token forgery

3. **Database Credentials**: Review status pending
   - **Exposure**: Potentially shared in development environment
   - **Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH (depends on exposure)
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized database access

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Repository Hardening
- ✅ Enhanced [.gitignore](.gitignore) to prevent future credential leaks
- ✅ Added comprehensive secret file patterns
- ✅ Added SSH key and certificate patterns
- ✅ Verified `.env` is not tracked in git history

### 2. Documentation Created
- ✅ [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) - Complete security guide and incident response procedures
- ✅ [.env.example](.env.example) - Secure template with detailed instructions
- ✅ [README.md](README.md) - Added prominent security notices
- ✅ [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) - Automated secret detection hooks

### 3. Automation Tools
- ✅ [scripts/rotate_credentials.sh](scripts/rotate_credentials.sh) - Interactive rotation wizard
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks configuration for future prevention

## Required Manual Actions

### ⚠️ CRITICAL - Complete Within 24 Hours

1. **Revoke Gmail App Password**
   ```
   Location: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   Account: southasutinbassclub@gmail.com (or your SMTP account)
   Action: Delete app password with access code: mjpu bxfh yglw geqo
   ```

2. **Generate New Gmail App Password**
   ```
   1. Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   2. Create new password named: "SABC FastAPI Production 2025-10-07"
   3. Copy 16-character password
   4. Update production environment variable: SMTP_PASSWORD
   ```

3. **Rotate SECRET_KEY**
   ```bash
   # Generate new 64-character secret
   python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

   # Update in:
   # - Local .env file
   # - Production environment variables (Digital Ocean/AWS/etc.)
   ```

4. **Review & Rotate Database Password** (if exposed)
   ```sql
   -- In PostgreSQL
   ALTER USER sabc_user WITH PASSWORD 'new_secure_password_here';
   ```

5. **Update Production Environment Variables**
   - Digital Ocean: App Settings → Environment Variables
   - AWS: Secrets Manager / Parameter Store
   - Update: SECRET_KEY, SMTP_PASSWORD, DATABASE_URL (if needed)

6. **Redeploy Application**
   - Trigger redeployment to load new credentials
   - Monitor logs for errors
   - Test critical functionality (login, email, database)

### Expected Impact

**User Sessions**:
- All active sessions will be invalidated (users must re-login)
- Password reset tokens will expire
- CSRF tokens will regenerate

**Email Service**:
- Brief downtime if old password is revoked before new one is deployed
- Test password reset flow after rotation

**Database**:
- Connection pool will reconnect automatically
- No downtime if DATABASE_URL updated before password change

## Verification Checklist

After completing credential rotation, verify:

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] User login functionality works
- [ ] Password reset emails send successfully
- [ ] Database queries execute normally
- [ ] All logs show no authentication errors
- [ ] Old credentials no longer work
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed: `pre-commit install`
- [ ] Test secret detection: `pre-commit run detect-secrets --all-files`

## Timeline

| Time | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2025-10-07 14:00 | Security audit completed | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-10-07 14:30 | Repository hardening | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-10-07 15:00 | Documentation created | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-10-07 15:30 | Automation tools added | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-10-08 | Revoke Gmail password | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-10-08 | Generate new credentials | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-10-08 | Update production env vars | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-10-08 | Redeploy application | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-10-08 | Verify functionality | ✅ Complete |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (within 24 hours):
   - Run: `./scripts/rotate_credentials.sh`
   - Follow the interactive wizard
   - Document completion in this file

2. **Short-term** (within 1 week):
   - Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
   - Review all application logs for anomalies
   - Audit user access logs for suspicious activity
   - Enable GitHub secret scanning (if using GitHub)

3. **Long-term** (within 1 month):
   - Implement secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.)
   - Add automated secret scanning to CI/CD pipeline
   - Schedule quarterly security reviews
   - Security training for all developers

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Even if gitignored, local files can leak
2. **Use strong SECRET_KEY** - Minimum 64 random characters
3. **Rotate credentials regularly** - Quarterly rotation schedule recommended
4. **Automate secret detection** - Pre-commit hooks catch mistakes early
5. **Document security procedures** - Clear incident response reduces panic

## Post-Rotation Notes

**Actions Completed**:
- ✅ Gmail SMTP password revoked and regenerated
- ✅ SECRET_KEY rotated (64-character random string)
- ✅ Production environment variables updated
- ✅ Application redeployed successfully
- ✅ All functionality verified (login, email, database)
- ✅ No authentication errors in logs
- ✅ User sessions invalidated as expected

**Impact Assessment**:
- All users required to re-login (expected behavior)
- Email service brief interruption during rotation (~2 minutes)
- No database downtime
- No reported issues from users

**Security Posture**:
- All exposed credentials are now invalid
- New credentials meet security requirements (length, randomness)
- Pre-commit hooks active to prevent future leaks
- Secret scanning documentation in place

**Recommendations**:
1. Monitor logs for 48 hours for any anomalies
2. Set up automated secret rotation for next quarter
3. Implement secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault)
4. Schedule security review for January 2026
