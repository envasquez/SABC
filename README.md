# Background
Since the pandemic wiped out a lot of tournament fishing for the past couple of years (2019/2020), member attendance for club meetings and tournamnets is low. We've tried various methods to increase member participation but some are only effective for short periods of time.

Additionally, all of the South Austin Bass Club (SABC) process is very manual & paper-driven which is not archivable or mineable for data purposes.


# Goals
The goal of this website application is to modernize the South Austin Bass Clubs tournament and voting process.

This site will:
- Give tournament data and analytics for the club, lakes, individuals and teams
- Allow members to vote remotely on: Tournaments, Officers, and Bylaws
- Serve as a source of distributing club news, information and events
- Archive recent (and historical) club data
