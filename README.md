# Background
The COVID-19 pandemic wiped out a lot of tournament bass fishing in our local area (Austin, Tx) for the past couple of years. Member attendance for club meetings and tournaments is low stopped completely when lockdown protocols occured. Since the lockdown, attendance has remained low and growth has slowed. We've tried various methods to increase participation but some are only effective for short periods of time.

*Some* of our South Austin Bass Club (SABC) process is manual & hand-written which is not archivable or mineable for data purposes. Our tournament director has kept some spreadsheets on-line (Googledocs) that we may be able injest for historical data. We can possibly use this data for insights about making more informed choices for tournament events in the future.

Lastly, our only medium for information transfer to non-members or potential members is through social media platforms (of which there are many) that come with their own maintenance overhead. Some members may not want or know how to join social media platform X just to get tournament information. We could use a neutral, (and cheap) platform to host this platform that social media can point to.


# Goals
The goal of this website application are to:
- Modernize the South Austin Bass Clubs tournament and voting process.
- Give tournament data and analytics for the club, lakes, individuals and teams
- Allow members to vote remotely on: Tournaments, Officers, and Bylaws (and more)
- Serve as a source of distributing club news, information and events to members and potential members
- Archive recent (and historical) club data
- Eliminate the need for manual process

We hope to increase member participation by modernizing our model of interaction and providing data analytics & insights. Also by allowing members to participate remotely vs. in-person exclusively will hopefully increase tournament attendance which should increase commradrie and growth.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/envasquez/SABC/wiki) for an informal write-up to capture some requirements, this site's purpose, solution space and design decisions. Basically ... a one page specification.

Initially, to learn more about some of Django's more modern features, I followed many of the recommendations from [this Tutorial from Corey Schafer](https://youtu.be/UmljXZIypDc) for writing a web application, and modified it to suite the club's needs.
