### Poll Workflow
1. **Admin creates poll** with options and time window
2. **Members vote** during active period
3. **Poll closes** automatically at deadline
4. **Winning option** determines tournament details
5. **Tournament created** automatically from poll results

## 🔒 Security & Authentication

### Defense-in-Depth Security Architecture

SABC implements a comprehensive, multi-layered security approach to protect member data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain system integrity. Security is enforced at every layer from network to application to database.

### User Roles & Authorization

- **Anonymous** - Public content access only (tournament results, calendar, club information)
- **Members** - Voting rights, member areas, tournament participation, profile management
- **Admins** - Full management access, critical operations, user management, poll creation

**Authorization Model:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at route level
- Granular permissions with helper functions (`require_admin`, `require_member`)
- Session-based authentication with secure cookie handling
- Automatic session expiration and renewal

### Authentication & Session Security

**Password Security:**
- bcrypt hashing with automatic salt generation (cost factor: 12)
- Password validation on registration and login
- Secure password reset flow via email verification
- No plaintext password storage or transmission

**Session Management:**
- Secure HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS session theft
- CSRF tokens on all state-changing operations
- Session expiration and automatic renewal
- Logout invalidates server-side session state

### Input Validation & Data Protection

**Request Validation:**
- Pydantic models validate all input data with strict type checking
- SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries prevents SQL injection
- HTML escaping in Jinja2 templates prevents XSS attacks
- File upload restrictions and validation (if applicable)

**Data Sanitization:**
- All user input sanitized before database insertion
- Template auto-escaping enabled by default
- JSON data validation for poll options and structured data
- Email validation using standard RFC-compliant patterns

### Network & Application Security

**HTTP Security Headers:**
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking
- X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME sniffing
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) for HTTPS enforcement

**API Security:**
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Request size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- CORS configuration for API access control
- Secure error handling (no sensitive data in error messages)

### Automated Security Scanning

**Pre-commit Security Hooks:**

The codebase includes comprehensive automated security checks that run before every commit:

- **Bandit** - Python security linter detecting common vulnerabilities (hardcoded passwords, SQL injection patterns, insecure functions)
- **detect-private-key** - Scans for accidentally committed SSH keys, SSL certificates, and private keys
- **Ruff** - Modern Python linter with security-focused rules
- **MyPy** - Type safety enforcement prevents type-related security bugs
- **check-merge-conflict** - Prevents committing merge conflict markers
- **debug-statements** - Detects leftover debugger imports
- **trailing-whitespace** - Code hygiene and consistency

**Automated Testing:**

- **219 automated tests** (219 passing, 2 skipped) covering:
  - **SQL Injection Protection** - Tests parameterized queries and ORM safety
  - **CSRF Protection** - Validates token generation and verification
  - **XSS Prevention** - Tests template escaping and output sanitization
  - **Authorization Tests** - Verifies role-based access controls
  - **Authentication Tests** - Password hashing, session management, login flows
  - **Input Validation** - Pydantic model validation and edge cases

**Continuous Integration:**
- GitHub Actions runs full test suite on every pull request
- All security tests must pass before merge
- Pre-commit hooks enforce code quality and security standards

### Secret Management Best Practices

**Environment Variables:**
- All secrets stored in environment variables (never in code)
- `.env` files gitignored to prevent accidental commits
- `.env.example` provides template without sensitive data
- Production secrets managed via platform environment (Digital Ocean, AWS)

**Secret Rotation:**
- Regular rotation of `SECRET_KEY` and database credentials
- SMTP password rotation documented in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- API keys and tokens managed securely
- Immediate rotation procedures for compromised secrets

**Protected Secrets:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SECRET_KEY` - Session encryption and CSRF tokens
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` - Email service authentication
- `SENTRY_DSN` - Error monitoring service key

### Security Monitoring & Incident Response

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Failed login attempts tracked via Prometheus metrics
- Sentry captures security-related errors and exceptions
- Suspicious activity patterns trigger alerts
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

**Audit Logging:**
- Admin actions logged with timestamps and user context
- Database changes tracked via SQLAlchemy events
- Authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts) recorded
- Critical operations require explicit admin authorization

For detailed monitoring configuration and incident response procedures, see the [🔍 Monitoring & Observability](#-monitoring--observability) section below.

### Security Compliance & Best Practices

**Development Standards:**
- Type-safe codebase prevents entire classes of vulnerabilities
- Code review required for all security-sensitive changes
- Security testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

**Deployment Security:**
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for all production traffic
- Firewall configuration restricts unnecessary ports
- Database access limited to application layer
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

**Data Privacy:**
- Minimal data collection (only necessary for functionality)
- Sensitive data filtered before sending to Sentry
- Member contact information restricted to authenticated users
- GDPR-compliant data handling practices

### Security Documentation

For comprehensive security information:
- **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** - Security policies, vulnerability reporting, credential rotation
- **[docs/MONITORING.md](docs/MONITORING.md)** - Monitoring setup and incident response
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Secure development practices

**Reporting Security Vulnerabilities:**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:
1. Do NOT open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to the maintainers (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))
3. Allow reasonable time for response and patching
4. Coordinate public disclosure timing

## 🔍 Monitoring & Observability

SABC implements comprehensive monitoring and observability to ensure system reliability, detect issues proactively, and maintain optimal performance. The monitoring stack provides real-time insights into application health, user behavior, and security incidents.

### Monitoring Stack Overview

**Dual-layer Monitoring:**
- **Sentry** - Error tracking, exception monitoring, and performance profiling
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection, time-series data, and application instrumentation

**Benefits:**
- Proactive issue detection before users report problems
- Performance degradation alerts and trend analysis
- Security incident detection (failed logins, anomalies)
- Data-driven decision making for optimization
- Historical analysis and capacity planning

### Sentry Error Tracking

**Automatic Error Capture:**
- All unhandled exceptions automatically reported to Sentry
- Full stack traces with local variable context
- HTTP request context (method, URL, headers, user agent)
- User context (authenticated user ID and email)
- Environment and release tracking for deployment correlation

**Privacy-First Configuration:**
- Sensitive data automatically filtered before transmission
- HTTP headers filtered: `authorization`, `cookie`, `x-csrf-token`
- Environment variables filtered: `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`
- Query strings and form data excluded (may contain tokens/passwords)
- PII scrubbing for email addresses and personal data

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Transaction traces for slow requests (10% sampling in production)
- Database query performance tracking via SQLAlchemy integration
- HTTP request duration and throughput metrics
- Bottleneck identification and optimization opportunities

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Enable Sentry by setting DSN environment variable
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-key@sentry.io/your-project-id

# Optional: Track deployments and releases
RELEASE_VERSION=v1.2.3
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

**Sampling Strategy:**
- Production: 10% of transactions (reduces overhead and costs)
- Development/Test: 0% (no performance data collected)
- Errors: 100% capture rate (all errors reported)

### Prometheus Metrics

**HTTP Request Metrics:**
- `http_requests_total{method, endpoint, status}` - Total request count by method, endpoint, and status code
- `http_request_duration_seconds{method, endpoint}` - Request latency histogram (0.01s to 10s buckets)

**Database Metrics:**
- `db_query_duration_seconds{query_type}` - Database query latency histogram
- `db_connections_active` - Current active database connections

**Application Metrics:**
- `active_sessions` - Number of active user sessions
- `poll_votes_total{poll_type}` - Total poll votes by poll type
- `failed_logins_total` - Total failed login attempts (security monitoring)
- `email_sent_total{email_type, status}` - Email delivery tracking

**Metrics Endpoint:**
```
GET /metrics
```

Returns metrics in Prometheus text format for scraping. **IMPORTANT**: Restrict access via firewall in production to prevent unauthorized metric access.

**Grafana Dashboards:**

Example queries for monitoring dashboards:
- Request rate: `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`
- Request latency (p95): `histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`
- Error rate: `rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])`
- Failed login rate: `rate(failed_logins_total[5m])`

### Security Monitoring Integration

**Failed Login Tracking:**
- `failed_logins_total` metric increments on authentication failures
- Alert on rate > 50/minute (potential brute force attack)
- Grafana dashboards visualize attack patterns
- Sentry captures detailed error context for investigation

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Unusual traffic patterns detected via request rate metrics
- Database connection pool exhaustion alerts
- Slow query detection via `db_query_duration_seconds`
- Email delivery failure monitoring

**Incident Response Workflow:**
1. Alert triggered via Prometheus/Grafana or Sentry
2. Review metrics and error context in monitoring dashboards
3. Investigate logs and database state
4. Deploy fixes and monitor recovery
5. Post-incident review and documentation

### Performance Monitoring

**Real-time Performance Tracking:**
- Sub-200ms target for page load times
- Database query optimization via latency metrics
- Slow transaction identification in Sentry
- Resource utilization tracking

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- Request error rate > 5%
- Request latency p95 > 1 second
- Database query latency p95 > 100ms
- Active database connections > 80% of pool size
- Failed login rate > 50/minute

**Performance Impact:**
- Sentry: ~1-2ms overhead per request (10% sampling)
- Prometheus: < 1ms per request
- Total monitoring overhead: < 3ms per request

### Monitoring Best Practices

**Daily Operations:**
1. Review Sentry dashboard for new or recurring errors
2. Check Grafana dashboards for performance degradation
3. Monitor alert notifications (email/Slack)
4. Analyze slow queries and optimize as needed
5. Track user activity metrics (poll votes, logins)

**Deployment Tracking:**
- Set `RELEASE_VERSION` environment variable for each deployment
- Sentry tracks errors by release for regression detection
- Compare metrics before and after deployment
- Monitor error rates during rollout

**Documentation:**
For detailed monitoring setup, Prometheus configuration, and Grafana dashboard creation, see [docs/MONITORING.md](docs/MONITORING.md).

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production: Docker Compose on Digital Ocean Droplet

**Current production deployment** uses Docker Compose with:

- **Docker Containers** - Web (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, Nginx, Certbot
- **Manual Deployment** - SSH → git pull → [restart.sh](restart.sh)
- **SSL** - Let's Encrypt via Certbot
- **Cost** - ~$12/month (Basic Droplet + included bandwidth)

**Deployment:**
```bash
ssh root@<production-ip>
cd /opt/sabc
./restart.sh  # Pulls latest code, rebuilds containers, restarts
```

See [docker-compose.prod.yml](docker-compose.prod.yml) for full configuration.

### Staging: Same Docker Setup on Separate Droplet

For safe testing before production deployment:

- **Infrastructure** - Separate droplet mirroring production
- **Configuration** - [STAGING_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/STAGING_DEPLOYMENT.md)
