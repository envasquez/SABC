### Tournament Format

G. All tournaments are team tournaments with a "pick your own partner" format.

### Paper Tournaments

I. Paper Tournaments are tournaments where fish are measured instead of weighed.

   1. Fish are measured and recorded on a chart, verified by the non-boater.
   2. At weigh-in the total stringer weight is determined from a length to weight conversion chart for your longest 5 (five) fish.
   3. The club will provide paper charts when paper tournaments are fished.
   4. The actual weighed weight will be used to determine Big Bass and the paper weight will be used for the stringer weight and does not count for the Heavy Stringer of the Year Award.
   5. Boater must have an accurate measuring board in the boat.
   6. The club chart has ½ (one-half) inch increments. Fish must be at least 12 (twelve) inches to record on the chart.
   7. Fish must be measured on a flat board with a perpendicular end. Fish must be placed flat on the board with mouth closed and pressed against the perpendicular end. Tail may be manipulated to determine maximum length. Tip of tail must touch the line for the minimum length. If a fish measures anywhere between the ½ (one-half) inch mark you must record the shorter length.
   8. Only fish shorter or longer than the slot limit can be kept and brought to weigh-in. Only 1 (one) fish over the slot limit may be brought to weigh-in for the Big Bass Award.
   9. If an angler fishes a paper tournament solo, they can opt to Catch, Photo, Release (CPR) - where the photo of the fish must be measured according to the rules above, and contain an identifier for each fish (i.e. a number, color or something to differentiate fish).
